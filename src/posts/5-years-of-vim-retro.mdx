title: 5 years of (Neo)Vim - A personal retrospective
abstract: It's been just over 5 years since I've switched to Vim/Neovim and started living inside the terminal full-time. Here's a look back on that journey and how my usage of it has changed over time.

In mid 2017, during the tail end of my first year of studies, I decided to take a plunge and dive into using Vim as my full-time text editor. The switch had been a long time coming, and given that in November the previous year I installed Arch Linux on my laptop one could say it was pretty much _destined_. I'd _known_ about Vim since starting my programming education (in first year of my degree), but as a fresh introductee to all things coding, I was already overwhelmed by too many other things (mainly, how to code) to be trying anything too ambitious other than Atom or IntelliJ. Yet, I was eventually lured over by the promises of blazing, extreme customization options and most importantly, how _cool_ I would look being a h4Ck3r boy that did everything inside a terminal. And boy, has the last 5 years been a ride...

## The beginnings: Vim and Tmux, and a few plugins

## Switching to Neovim (for no reason)

## Adding real autocomplete with Deoplete

## The renaissance with CoC

## Neovim LSP and Lua 

## What the future awaits
