I'm writing this post now not necessarily because I feel like it, but because I'd like  to deploy this blog sooner than later and it'd certainly be a little silly to deploy a blog _without_ any actual blog posts. At the same time, some of the topics I want to write about will probably take me a few days to write about, so I figured I might as well start with a quick introduction about myself as a reference for any readers who may stumble upon here from my future posts.

### My background...

I studied Mathematics and Computer Science at Imperial College London, graduating in 2020. Initially, I had almost 0 background in computer science/programming - my interest lay mostly in mathematics, and I simply tacked on the computer science bit for employability. However, once I arrived at Imperial, I fell in love with the computer science/programming/software engineering aspect of the degree, which lay the foundations of the road which I find myself on today.

### I've worked in...

I've primarily been working as a full-stack web/app developer since graduating, with a little bit of dabbling in some infrastructure and analytics. TypeScript has been a huge part of what I've been doing - both on the frontend and backend. React (and React Native) are staples of my frontend work, with NestJS being major mention for my backend. That said, I'm hoping to move out of web development (more specifically, frontend development) soon as the more I work on it, the more I think it's a solved problem with very little few interesting challenges left in. I still enjoy the product-building angle of that though, but the engineering challenges are starting to bore me.

### What I'll probably be writing about
- Software engineering. Both from technical and management aspect.
- Programming languges and programming language design.
- Developer tools (particularly neovim) and my experiences with them
