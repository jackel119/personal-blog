Hey there! I'm Jack, and nice to meet you!

### What I do

I studied Mathematics and Computer Science at Imperial College. In the past few years, I've primarily been doing full stack software engineering, with a little bit of dabbling in some infrastructure and analytics. TypeScript has been a huge part of what I've been doing - both on the frontend and backend. Currently, I'm working at a startup trying to revolutionize pet care (and petting a lot of cats and dogs during office hours).

### What you can expect from this blog
- Software engineering and architecture. Both from technical and managerial aspects.
- Programming languages and programming language design.
- Developer tools (particularly neovim) and my experiences with them
- Cloud and DevOps discussions.
