Since its inception, Kubernetes has been known and thought of as being a "container orchestration platform". Whilst this is still undoubtedly true, its also not the full picture anymore. In fact, I'm going to argue that Kubernetes can now be thought of as a full fat, highly configurable infrastructure platform.

I previously wrote about my experiences diving into Kubernetes for the first time, and the various pros and cons that I encountered. Everything I opinion I had there still holds true, however after some further experimentation and tinkering, I’m even more inclined to go _all in_ on Kube now - not just as a a platform for running applications, but for running _everything_ one would need in a cloud environment.

# Managed Kubernetes Services that give you everything

In the early days of Kubernetes, you had to manage _everything_ yourself. Install `kubeadm` on some baremetal machines or EC2 instances, upgrade control plane nodes, all whilst trying to minimize downtime and interruptions - you get the idea. You needed not just a good understanding of how to use Kubernetes, but also how it worked under the hood in order to administrate and troubleshoot a cluster.

These days, the story is very different. Every major cloud provider now has a "managed" Kubernetes service that handles almost everything for you - from control plane management, worker node provisioning, and version upgrades. 

 If you don't want to go with managed cloud solutions, various alternative "distributions" to `kubeadm` have also cropped up, i.e. Microk8s, k3s, Rancher. These distros have massively simplified installation and management processes if you wanted to run on baremetal or your own self-managed cluster, often allowing you to get a fresh node up and running within a few minutes.

Sure there are still _some_ complicated bits, but its nothing like it used to be - and over time, these complexities are only going to get easier and more abstracted away from end users. I’ll be talking mostly in terms of running inside a managed cloud environment for the rest of the article, but what I say should also apply with on-perm installations with a few extra steps.

## The beginning

First, you need to run a stateless application - say, a super basic “Hello World” HTTP server. You set up a deployment, and a service. You then expose your service via an `Ingress`. Your `Ingress` of course needs a `LoadBalancer` to make it publicly accessible, so you provision your favorite one as well (e.g. NGINX or Traefik). Bam, your cloud provider has detected this and has automatically created a cloud load balancer for your Kubernetes load balancer as well.

Then, you realize you need to attach a custom domain to this endpoint. Traditionally, you’d go into the DNS provider of your choice, and manually attach an A or CNAME record to map the custom domain. But wait! If you have multiple environments/domains, or like to spin new environments up and down on demand, doing this manually isn’t a very scalable method.

There is where our first operator, [External DNS](TODO) comes in. External DNS does the following:

- It can interface with, and control external DNS providers (i.e. Route 53, Godaddy, etc).
- It can watch your internal Kube resources such as ingressses to decide which domains should map to which load balancers, and automatically manage DNS records for you.

## Databases and Storage

Having some stateless containerized applications and automatic DNS management is great, but that’s not going to be enough for your next billion dollar startup. You need persistent storage, such as databases or object storage.

In the early days, the consensus was that you shouldn’t put anything stateful inside Kube at all, because Kubernetes itself doesn’t have any mechanism of persistent storage or backups. For databases, you’d be advised to spin up a cloud managed database like RDS or Cloud SQL, whilst if you wanted object store you’d gear towards S3 or equivalent.

Whilst Kubernetes itself hasn’t necessarily improved its built-in storage management capabilities (well, it doesn’t really have any) - the general knowledge and understanding around handling storage via Kubernetes has improved drastically, and so has the tools and plugins in the ecosystem. Managed Kube services also have improved in terms of automatic provisioning of storage volumes (i.e. EFS/EBS on AWS). [This video](TODO) summarizes pretty well what’s changed in the past few years in this space.

Take PostgreSQL for an example - we can use [Cloud Native PG](TODO) operator to provision high-availability, multi-replica PostgreSQL installation within a cluster. All that needs to be done is to configure what `PersistentVolumeClaim`s/`StorageClass`es to use, and where to back up data. I won’t go into too much specific detail of different operators, but you can also do things with this CloudNativePG that may not be possible out of the box with cloud-managed databases like RDS - for example, setting up an entire replica cluster of any other arbitrarily-hosted Postgres database.

Of course, Postgres isn’t the only option here - whatever your database needs, there’s probably a production-ready operator or Helm chart for it:

- Redis
- MySQL
- MongoDB

Well, what about object storage? Turns out there’s also [`MinIO`](TODO) - an open source, S3-compatible object storage system that - you guessed it - can be self hosted inside Kube.

## Message Queues and Streams

You can also rejoice with your message queue and pub/sub needs, as the following are also available:

- RabbitMQ Cluster Operator
- Kafka

## Honorary mention - data pipeline tools

I’m not a data engineer, so my knowledge on data ETL/pipeline tooling is pretty sparse. That said, a quick google search yielded that the following tools can also be self-hosted in Kubernetes

- Airbyte
- Airflow

## Networking and Service Meshes

In large productionised clusters, you may want to use service meshes to facilitate and monitor service-to-service communication. Fortunately, these tools have been around for years in the Kubernetes world:

- Istio
- Cillium

## Infrastructure Access

So, now you’ve got a number of clusters set up. How are your engineers going to access these clusters, and how are you going to manage their permissions. The Kubernetes-native way is to setup signed certificates and RBAC roles per user, per cluster, or you can use your cloud platform to generate access kubeconfigs. Neither of these are particularly automatic or idiosyncratic, but that’s where “Infrastructure Access Platform”s come in. IAPs basically aim to simplify access control over a number of different pieces of infrastructure (i.e. Kube clusters, or SSH servers), and usually via accessible methods like SSO. There’s a number of IAPs out there, some of which you can self-host inside your own cluster:

- Teleport
- Infra
- HashiCorp Boundary
- StrongDM
 
I use Teleport, as it’s open source yet has really good support for self-hosting, and can also manage non-Kubernetes infrastructure like Postgres databases as well as having a bunch of other features like auditing and a nice UI for management as well as a Kubernetes operator.
 
## CI/CD
 
By this point you’ve already got at least one cluster running, with quite a few resources. You know what would save money? Hosting your CI/CD pipelines within one of your clusters, on hardware that you’re probably already paying for! Once again, our options are plenty more:
 
 - GitHub Actions are free for self hosted runners, which you can host with the Actions Runner Controller chart.
 - GitLab is entirely self-hostable, and that of course comes with GitLab CI/CD.
 - Unsurprisingly, Jenkins can run in a self hosted cluster too.
 - CircleCI runners can be self hosted
 - Tekton and Concourse are other good examples of up-and-coming Kubernetes-native CI solutions.
 - A quick google search yields a large number of other options you may want to explore.
 
In addition to “traditional” CI/CD platforms, it’s also worth mentioning the Kubernetes-specific CI platforms ArgoCD and Flux (which are of course, self-hostable).

If you use [Terraform](TODO), you might also want to think about using [Atlantis](TODO) as well.

## Version Control

By this point, since you’re self hosting so much already, why not throw in Git platforms?

- GitLab, as previously mentioned
- Gitea
- GitBucket

## Operators and CRDs

I’ve used the word “operator” quite a bit throughout this article. If you already know what a Kubernetes operator is, then you can skip this bit. Otherwise, this might be the most important takeaway from this article for you.

## Crossplane

Say you _don’t_ want to put everything inside a cluster, or have vendor-specific services like SQS that you can’t afford to migrate away from. By this point, almost all of your infrastructure is in Kubernetes already, so having some configuration _outside_ of Kubernetes might be a little annoying at this point. Worry not - because with the power of Kubernetes operators, we can manage resources external of Kubernetes from inside Kubernetes!

More specifically, [Crossplane](TODO) is a tool that creates CRDs that allow you to manage vendor-specific cloud services.

# What's holding it back?

## Good IaaC

## Secrets Management

One thing Kube isn’t great at yet, is secrets management. To be clear - Kube _does_ offer `Secret`s in its native API. However, the secrets aren’t encrypted by default. You _can_ set up [encryption at rest](TODO) in Kube, but it’s not entirely a straightforward/managed solution like HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager is. Secure secrets management is, generally speaking a pretty difficult beast. That said, the ecosystem does have a number of great tooling around secrets:

- Random secrets TODO
- Sealed secrets.
- Reloader, for refreshing your pods whenever secrets are updated
- 

# TL;DR

Just self host _every damn thing_ you need inside Kubernetes.
